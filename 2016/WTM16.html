                            I attended the <a href="https://www.womentechmakers.com/">International Women's Day Summit</a> at Google, London. I met some fantastic women in tech and had the honor to see the following speak:

                           As last time, WTM was an inspirational experience. Daunting though it is to be around so many talented and successful women, it drives you to do all you can to do better.
                           </p><p class="col-right">
                           The night started with a talk from Sarah Gordon. The most striking part of the opening remarks to me  was the exploration of inclusion beyond just gender. She spoke of 
                           considering race, disability and anything else that people may indentify themselves by.
                           </p><p class="col-right">
                           This was followed by a fireside chat from Dr Black and Sarah Drinkwater. Dr Black spoke of how she got to where she has got to be. She talked about her work with 
                           <a href="http://www.savingbletchleypark.org/"> Bletchley Park</a>, <a href="http://techmums.co/">Tech Mums</a> and Women in Tech causes in general. The key lesson from 
                           this was the importance of resilience in becoming                            successful.

                           After, there was one of my favourite talks of the evening - Defying Expectations by Sparky. She talked of her career so far and the importance of support and
                           mentorship. She spoke about how these along with mutual supportiveness can help combat imposter syndrome as well as helping people finding their callings. The importance of 
                           people in a tech career and being supportive of those in our field in any way we can is a point I can really get behind.

                           The panel discussion that followed explored the womens' careers and the advice they could give based on them. This advice included nto to freak out in public,
                           to keep a journal and that trustworthyness is a hard to find and precious characteristic.

                           Alice Zimmerman then explored the 7 areas of technology where there were opportunties for innovation. These were 1) Physical web / IoT, 2) Making people trust tech,
                           3) Making tech more human focused, 4) Progressive webapps that are designed around human need, 5) Defending and enforcign rights including freedom of access and speech, 
                           6) Artificial Intelligence and 7) Language. She said to "Dare to be the 12 year old fantasy" - to chase those dreams you had as a child and make them a reality. The talk was
                           delivered with great enthusiasm and passion. Many people were buzzing about what they wanted to create based on it.
                           </p><p>
                           Finally, there were closing remarks about the great work WTM has been doing globally. All of the speakers were very open at the networking event afterwards, though sadly
                           I had a train to catch so couldn't remain for very long.
