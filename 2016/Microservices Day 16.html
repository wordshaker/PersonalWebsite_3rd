                            Fred George is a pretty well known speaker, so admittedly I was excited to see him speak. In this talk he explored the hot topics surrounding microservices, 
                            which pretty much covered the common themes throughout the whole day. He then went on to discuss the [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework)
                            and how it acn be used to judge how profitable a solution to a problem may be as well as whether a company should use traditional or non-traditional methods to solve it.
                            </p><p>
                            He went on to discuss the 5 points which can help an organisation progress:
                            <ol>1. Understand your problem.</ol>
                            <ol>2. If it is a complex problem, you need to be able to fail fast as "experimentation drive innovation".</ol>
                            <ol>3. If it is a complex problem, re-think interactions - consider the interaction with customer at feature level rather than story level.</ol>
                            <ol>4. Measure what matters - expose developers to business success metrics, customer retention, clicks. Make the impact of their work visible.</ol>
                            <ol>5. Mitigate organisational inhibitors - this includes over-specialisation and too many managers, none of which have a clear overall picture.</ol>
                            </p><p>
                            Fred George also explored the heirachy of development. Thoguht I saw his vision here, personally I am still a strong advocate for a flat structure.
                            A flat structure encourages the idea that everyones view is valid, as the only difference between a senior / junior is their experiences, and as such
                            both can have a valid point of view. Fred explored a much more heirarchical structure which rewarded knowledge - but personally I find such structures can
                            introduce bad attitudes.
