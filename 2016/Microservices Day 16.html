                        All of the talks are available on Youtube. Below is a list of a few of my favourites:
                        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VC6YeQeZVk">Richard Rodger - Solving service discovery: Node.js microservices without a registry:</a></b>
                            This talk went through the lessons learnt by Nearform in there 5 years of working with microservices. Richard first stated that automated deployment is essential 
                            to be able to work efficiently with microservices. He also went on to praise [Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) as an example of intelligent load balancing.
                            He argued that 'service discovery' is now an antipattern and that we should make message first class citizens, using them to define patterns. In this it should not matter 
                            where a message ends up or how it got there, only that a service is interested in something it contains.
                            </p><p>
                            He went on to discuss that each service should have a local view of itself, but there should be a self-updating global view using
                            [SWIM](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf) (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol). In this each service pings random 
                            services. This knowledge is then shared on to the next set of pings, and so the process continues. Using this process we can see which services are up and which are not. At convergence you get 
                            complete knowledge of the entire system and all this happens in milliseconds. This is useful for scalability and composability.    
                            </p><p>
                            An example of the implemenation of a microservices architecture using Node.JS written by Richard can be found [here](https://github.com/senecajs/ramanujan). This is a Twitter like app that
                            uses the Seneca microservices framework that is also a good example of the SWIM protocol for peer-to-peer discovery.

                        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKTtnVb83mQ">Fred George - How to enable organizations to go faster:</a></b>
                            Fred George is a pretty well known speaker, so admittedly I was excited to see him speak. In this talk he explored the hot topics surrounding microservices, 
                            which pretty much covered the common themes throughout the whole day. He then went on to discuss the [Cynefin Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework)
                            and how it acn be used to judge how profitable a solution to a problem may be as well as whether a company should use traditional or non-traditional methods to solve it.
                            </p><p>
                            He went on to discuss the 5 points which can help an organisation progress:
                            <ol>1. Understand your problem.</ol>
                            <ol>2. If it is a complex problem, you need to be able to fail fast as "experimentation drive innovation".</ol>
                            <ol>3. If it is a complex problem, re-think interactions - consider the interaction with customer at feature level rather than story level.</ol>
                            <ol>4. Measure what matters - expose developers to business success metrics, customer retention, clicks. Make the impact of their work visible.</ol>
                            <ol>5. Mitigate organisational inhibitors - this includes over-specialisation and too many managers, none of which have a clear overall picture.</ol>
                            </p><p>
                            Fred George also explored the heirachy of development. Thoguht I saw his vision here, personally I am still a strong advocate for a flat structure.
                            A flat structure encourages the idea that everyones view is valid, as the only difference between a senior / junior is their experiences, and as such
                            both can have a valid point of view. Fred explored a much more heirarchical structure which rewarded knowledge - but personally I find such structures can
                            introduce bad attitudes.
